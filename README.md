## Scientific Programming with Python

The goal of these lessons is to introduce programming for undergraduates in MAE3145.
The focus is simultaneously:

1. Gain some skills with Python
2. Learn best practices for writing/debugging/testing code for engineering courses/applications.

This is not a comprhensive introduction to Python, but rather covers most of the critical skills needed by students in engineering courses.
It is based on much of my experience/notes from Astro 201/321 at USAFA, as well as the experiences since then in graduate school/Air Force Research Laboratory.

## Lessons

These aren't in any specific order, but this seems to make some sense:

* [Installation][2]
* [Functions][3]
* [Input/Output][ 4 ]
* [Documentation][5]
* [Debugging][6]
* [Algorithms][1]
