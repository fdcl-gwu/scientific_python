## Scientific Programming with Python

The goal of these lessons is to introduce programming for undergraduates in MAE3145. 
The focus is simultaneously:

1. Gain some skills with Python
2. Learn best practices for writing/debugging/testing code for engineering courses/applications.

This is not a comprhensive introduction to Python, but rather covers most of the critical skills needed by students in engineering courses. 
It is based on much of my experience/notes from Astro 201/321 at USAFA, as well as the experiences since then in graduate school/Air Force Research Laboratory.

## Lessons

These aren't in any specific order, but this seems to make some sense:

* [Installation](installation.pdf)
* [Functions](functions.pdf)
* [Input/Output](input_output.pdf)
* [Documentation](documentation.pdf)
* [Debugging](debugging.pdf)
* [Algorithms](algorithms.pdf)
