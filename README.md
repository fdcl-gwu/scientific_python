## Scientific Programming with Python

The goal of these lessons is to introduce programming for undergraduates in MAE3145.
The focus is simultaneously:

1. Gain some skills with Python
2. Learn best practices for writing/debugging/testing code for engineering courses/applications.

This is not a comprehensive introduction to Python, but rather covers most of the critical skills needed by students in engineering courses.
It is based on much of my experience/notes from Astro 201/321 at USAFA, as well as the experiences since then in graduate school/Air Force Research Laboratory.
